## Docker

``` sh
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 -v '/path/to/output:/app/output' rhasspy/piper-recording-studio
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 to select a language and start recording.

Add `--help` to see more options.


### Building

``` sh
docker build . -t rhasspy/piper-recording-studio
```


## Installing without Docker

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/rhasspy/piper-recording-studio.git
cd piper-recording-studio/

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running without Docker

``` sh
python3 -m piper_recording_studio
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 to select a language and start recording.

Prompts are in the `prompts/` directory with the following format:

* Language directories are named `<language name>_<language code>`
* Each `.txt` in a language directory contains lines with:
    * `<id>\t<text>` or
    * `text` (id is automatically assigned based on line number)

Output audio is written to `output/`

See `--debug` for more options.


## Exporting

Install ffmpeg:

``` sh
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Install exporting dependencies:

``` sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements_export.txt
```

Export recordings for a language to a Piper-compatible dataset (LJSpeech format):

``` sh
python3 -m export_dataset output/<language>/ /path/to/dataset
```

Requires a non-Docker install. If you used Docker to record your dataset, you may need to adjust the permissions of the output directory:

``` sh
sudo chown -R "$(id -u):$(id -u)" output/
```

See `--help` for more options. You may need to adjust the silence detection parameters to correctly remove button clicks and keypresses.


## Multi-User Mode

``` sh
python3 -m piper_recording_studio --multi-user
```

Now a "login code" will be required to record. A directory `output/user_<code>/<language>` must exist for each user and language.
