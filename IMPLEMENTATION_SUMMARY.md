# Audio Processing & Training Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
All requested features have been successfully implemented and tested. The preprocessing system has been completely overhauled to be transparent, debuggable, and non-destructive.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Fixed Silent Preprocessing Failures
**Problem:** Preprocessing was failing silently with no user feedback
**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive error tracking with success/fail counters
- Created real-time console output showing each file being processed
- Added detailed status reporting (completed, partial, failed)
- Each file's processing result is logged with duration changes

**Test:** Run preprocessing on your Swedish files - you'll now see live console output showing exactly what's happening!

### 2. Restructured Preprocessing (Original Files Preserved)
**Problem:** Preprocessing overwrote original files
**Solution:**
- Original files stay in `recordings/` untouched
- Preprocessed files are saved to `recordings/preprocessed/`
- No more backup files needed - originals are always safe
- Clear separation between original and processed audio

**Location:** `voices/{profile}/recordings/preprocessed/`

### 3. Detailed Preprocessing Feedback
**Features Added:**
- Live console output with emoji indicators (✅ success, ❌ failure)
- Processing parameters displayed at start
- Per-file duration changes shown
- Final summary with success/failure counts
- Output location clearly displayed
- Progress bar with success/fail breakdown

**Example Console Output:**
```
📁 Output location: voices/Petter svenska pc/recordings/preprocessed
⚙️  Settings: Threshold=-40dB, Volume=-6dB, Rate=44100Hz, Padding=200ms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔍 Searching for files from: sv-SE_General, sv-SE_Chat
📊 Found 75 files to process
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ [1/75] 0001_sv-SE_General_20241013.wav - 3.45s → 3.62s (+0.17s)
✅ [2/75] 0002_sv-SE_General_20241013.wav - 2.89s → 3.04s (+0.15s)
...
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✨ Processing Complete!
   ✅ Successful: 75
   ❌ Failed: 0
   📁 Output: voices/Petter svenska pc/recordings/preprocessed
```

### 4. Fixed Checkpoint Download Error
**Problem:** Swedish NST checkpoint download showed "not valid JSON" error
**Solution:**
- Fixed error handling to use proper HTTPException instead of dict
- Added better error messages showing actual failure reasons
- Improved frontend to display detailed error information
- Added success message with checkpoint path

**Test:** Try downloading the sv-SE NST checkpoint again - errors will now be clear and actionable!

### 5. Training File Source Selection
**Features Added:**
- Radio buttons to choose "Original Recordings" vs "Preprocessed Recordings"
- Real-time file counts for both options
- Preprocessed option disabled if no preprocessed files exist
- File counts update when selecting prompt lists
- Backend support for loading from correct directory

**How It Works:**
1. Select voice profile and prompt lists
2. See file counts: "Original: 75 files" vs "Preprocessed: 75 files"
3. Choose which source to use for training
4. Training loads from appropriate directory

**Backend Changes:**
- `train_model.py`: Added `audio_source` parameter to `prepare_dataset()`
- `app.py`: New endpoint `/api/train/file-counts/{profile_id}` for counting files
- Automatically uses `recordings/` or `recordings/preprocessed/` based on selection

### 6. Export Local Copy
**Problem:** Exports only downloaded in browser, not saved locally
**Solution:**
- Unzipped copy automatically saved to `voices/{profile}/Exported datasets/{dataset_name}/`
- Same structure as ZIP file
- Includes all audio files, metadata.json, and transcripts.txt
- Success message shows both browser download AND local path

**Example:**
```
Export completed successfully!

📥 Browser download started
📁 Local copy saved to:
voices/Petter svenska pc/Exported datasets/sv-SE_General_20241013_143022/
```

### 7. Audio Comparison Tool
**Features Added:**
- Side-by-side audio player comparison
- Original vs Preprocessed playback
- Detailed statistics for both versions:
  - Duration
  - Sample rate
  - Channels
  - Volume (dBFS)
- Changes summary showing:
  - Duration difference
  - Volume change
  - Sample rate conversion

**How to Use:**
1. Go to Post-Process page
2. Scroll to "Audio Comparison Tool" section
3. Select voice profile
4. Choose a file from the dropdown (✓ indicates preprocessed version exists)
5. Click "Load Comparison"
6. Listen to both versions side-by-side and see the stats

## 🎯 Testing Your Setup

### Test Preprocessing
1. Open http://localhost:8000/postprocess
2. Select "Petter svenska pc" profile
3. Select your Swedish prompt lists (hold Ctrl to select multiple)
4. Click "Start Processing"
5. Watch the console output - you'll see:
   - Files being found
   - Each file processing with duration changes
   - Success/failure for each file
   - Final summary

**Expected Result:** 
- Console shows all 75 files processing
- Files saved to `voices/Petter svenska pc/recordings/preprocessed/`
- Each file trimmed with consistent 200ms silence padding
- All files normalized to -6dB volume

### Test Audio Comparison
1. After preprocessing completes
2. Scroll to "Audio Comparison Tool"
3. Select your profile and a file
4. Click "Load Comparison"
5. Listen to both versions
6. Check the statistics - you should see:
   - Consistent silence padding added
   - Volume normalized
   - Sample rate converted to 44.1kHz

### Test Training File Selection
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/train
2. Select "Petter svenska pc" profile
3. Select prompt lists
4. Look at file counts:
   - Original Recordings: 75 files
   - Preprocessed Recordings: 75 files (after preprocessing)
5. Choose which to use for training

### Test Export with Local Copy
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/export
2. Export your dataset
3. Check the alert message for local save path
4. Navigate to `voices/Petter svenska pc/Exported datasets/`
5. Find your exported folder with all files

## 📝 Answering Your Questions

### Q: "At what point are the WAV files connected to the prompts for the metadata?"
**A:** Immediately during recording! When you save a recording (line 1277-1287 in `app.py`):
1. Filename is generated (e.g., `0001_sv-SE_Chat_timestamp.wav`)
2. A metadata entry is created: `{"filename": "...", "sentence": "...", "prompt_list": "sv-SE_Chat"}`
3. This is appended to `metadata.jsonl` in real-time
4. The connection is permanent and survives all processing

### Q: "Why do preprocessed files sound the same?"
**A:** They were failing silently! With the new console output, you'll now see:
- If preprocessing actually runs
- Any errors that occur
- Duration changes (if silence is trimmed, duration will change)
- The padding should make all files have consistent silence

The preprocessing IS subtle by design:
- Volume normalization to -6dB (natural sounding)
- 200ms silence padding (barely noticeable)
- Silence trimming (removes dead air)

But you WILL notice:
- More consistent volume across files
- Exactly 200ms silence before and after speech
- Files in the `preprocessed/` folder

### Q: "How do I know if preprocessing worked?"
**A:** Now you have multiple ways to verify:
1. **Console Output:** Shows each file with duration changes
2. **File Location:** Check `voices/{profile}/recordings/preprocessed/` folder
3. **Audio Comparison Tool:** Listen side-by-side and see stats
4. **Summary:** Shows X successful, Y failed at the end
