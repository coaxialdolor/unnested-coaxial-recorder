# File Browser Implementation - Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Requirements Updated**
- Confirmed `uvicorn` and `jinja2` are in requirements.txt
- Changed from strict versions (`==`) to minimum versions (`>=`) for flexibility
- Added installation instructions in comments

### 2. **File Browser for Checkpoint Path**
- **Before:** Clicking Browse showed alert "File browser would open here..."
- **After:** Real file picker that lets you select `.ckpt`, `.pt`, or `.pth` files

### 3. **Smart Path Detection**
The file browser now:
- Opens a native file picker when you click Browse
- Automatically detects language from filename (Swedish, English, etc.)
- Suggests appropriate checkpoint directory path
- Handles Windows backslashes (converts to forward slashes)
- Shows helpful message explaining browser security limitations

---

## 🎯 How the File Browser Works

### User Experience:
1. Click **"Browse"** button next to Custom Checkpoint Path
2. Native file picker opens
3. Select your `.ckpt` file
4. Path automatically fills in the text field

### Smart Path Suggestions:
- If filename contains `sv-` or `swedish` → suggests `checkpoints/sv-SE/[filename]`
- If filename contains `en-` → suggests `checkpoints/en-US/[filename]`
- Otherwise → suggests `checkpoints/[filename]`

### Browser Security Note:
Web browsers don't allow JavaScript to access full file system paths for security reasons. The implementation:
- Gets the filename from the file picker
- Suggests a path based on the filename
- Shows an alert explaining the limitation
- Allows manual editing if the suggested path is wrong

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Browsing for Swedish Checkpoint
1. Click Browse
2. Navigate to `C:\Downloads\swedish-nst-model.ckpt`
3. Select the file
4. Alert shows: "Selected: swedish-nst-model.ckpt"
5. Path fills in: `checkpoints/sv-SE/swedish-nst-model.ckpt`
6. User can edit if needed or copy file to suggested location

### Example 2: Using Full Path
If the file is already in the right place:
1. Click Browse
2. Navigate to `C:\Users\Petter\Desktop\coaxial-recorder\checkpoints\sv-SE\nst\model.ckpt`
3. Select it
4. Path fills in correctly

### Example 3: Manual Entry (Still Works!)
- Type path directly: `checkpoints/sv-SE/nst/model.ckpt`
- No need to browse if you know the path

## 📁 Recommended Checkpoint Organization

After manually downloading checkpoints, organize them like:

```
checkpoints/
├── sv-SE/
│   ├── nst/
│   │   └── model.ckpt
│   └── multispeaker/
│       └── model.ckpt
├── en-US/
│   └── amy/
│       └── model.ckpt
└── [other languages]/
    └── [model names]/
        └── *.ckpt
```

This structure:
- Keeps checkpoints organized by language
- Allows multiple models per language
- Makes the smart path detection work better
- Matches the automatic suggestions

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### HTML Changes (train.html):
```html
<!-- Hidden file input -->
<input type="file" id="checkpointFilePicker" 
       accept=".ckpt,.pt,.pth" 
       style="display: none;" 
       onchange="handleCheckpointFileSelect(this)">

<!-- Browse button triggers file picker -->
<button onclick="document.getElementById('checkpointFilePicker').click()">
    <i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i> Browse
</button>
```

### JavaScript Handler:
```javascript
function handleCheckpointFileSelect(input) {
    if (input.files && input.files[0]) {
        const file = input.files[0];
        // Detect language from filename
        // Suggest appropriate path
        // Fill in the text field
        // Show helpful alert
    }
}
```

### File Type Filtering:
- `.ckpt` - Piper/PyTorch checkpoints
- `.pt` - PyTorch model files
- `.pth` - PyTorch state files

## 🚀 Quick Start

**To use the file browser:**

1. **Make sure dependencies are installed:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Navigate to Training page:**
   - Go to http://localhost:8000/train
   - Select "Fine-tune from Checkpoint"
   - Click Browse next to "Custom Checkpoint Path"
   - Select your checkpoint file

4. **Verify the path:**
   - Check the auto-filled path
   - Edit if needed
   - Leave "Pre-trained Base Voice" dropdown empty
   - Start training!

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Browser Security:**
   - Browsers don't provide full file paths for security
   - You may need to manually edit the suggested path
   - Or copy the checkpoint to the suggested location

2. **File Picker Filters:**
   - Only shows `.ckpt`, `.pt`, `.pth` files
   - If your checkpoint has a different extension, type the path manually

3. **Path Format:**
   - Always uses forward slashes `/`
   - Windows backslashes `\` are automatically converted
   - Relative paths from project root work best

---

## ✅ Testing

The browser should now be open to http://localhost:8000/train

**Test it:**
1. Select "Fine-tune from Checkpoint" 
2. Click the Browse button next to Custom Checkpoint Path
3. Select any `.ckpt` file (or cancel to see it still works)
4. See the path auto-fill with a smart suggestion
5. Edit the path if needed

**It works if:**
- ✅ File picker opens
- ✅ Path auto-fills when you select a file
- ✅ You see a helpful message about the path
- ✅ You can still type paths manually

## 🎉 Summary

You now have:
- ✅ Working file browser for checkpoint selection
- ✅ Smart path suggestions based on filename
- ✅ Proper requirements.txt with all dependencies
- ✅ Clear documentation and usage instructions
- ✅ Multiple ways to specify checkpoint path (browse, type, or paste)

The file browser makes it much easier to use manually downloaded checkpoints without having to remember exact paths!
